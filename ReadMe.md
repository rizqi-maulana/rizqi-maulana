# About Me:
My name is Muhammad Rizqi Maulana, I am 19 years old, a web fullstack developer and technology enthusiast. I have a strong passion for developing modern applications with a focus on security, and I am always eager to explore new technologies and automation solutions.

I have experience working as a developer and mentor in several teams, developing web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, React.js, and mentoring junior developers. Being active in communities and collaborative projects has enriched my skills in innovation, teamwork, and adapting to the fast-evolving tech landscape.

I also enjoy improving SEO for websites and experimenting with automation in development processes. Sharing my experiences and learning alongside the developer community, especially about application security and industry best practices, is something I highly value.

I am open to collaboration, technology discussions, and exploring fresh ideas in application development.
